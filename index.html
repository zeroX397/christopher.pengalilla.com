            <h2>About Myself</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Christopher Pengalilla. I am detail-oriented and dedicated professional with
                experience in project management and team coordination. Skilled in planing, leading cross- functional
                teams, and optimizing workflows to improve productivity. Good communication and problem-solving skills.
                Now I am a 5th semester student in University of Surabaya, Computer Science (Informatics) Major.
                Currently I am developing and learning Cyber Security skill via Capture the Flag (CTF) with my friends.
                CTF is a training method for people who grinds cyber security skill by hacking and exploit the
                vulnerabilities of the given labs or isolated (or containerized) environment. I learnt about many things
                from CTF, for example: web penetration, cryptography and crypto-analysis, reverse engineering, binary
                exploitation, and digital forensics.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am continuously refining and expanding my expertise in the field of Digital Forensics, a highly
                specialized area of cybersecurity that plays a critical role in the investigation of digital crimes
                and incidents. This discipline encompasses a vast array of sub-categories, each offering unique
                challenges and insights. Among these are Computer Forensics, which focuses on uncovering evidence
                from computer systems and storage devices; Network Forensics, dedicated to analyzing network traffic
                and identifying malicious activities; and Mobile Forensics, particularly in Android devices, where I
                delve into extracting and interpreting data from mobile phones. Additionally, Incident Handling and
                Response is a key area where I still practice on strategies to manage and mitigate the impact of
                security breaches, while Data Recovery teaches me the techniques to recover crucial information that
                may have been lost or damaged, or even just recovering <em>accidental</em> deletion.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I explore these diverse facets of Digital Forensics, I also gain an understanding of the
                techniques employed by malicious actors, specifically their use of <em>Anti-Forensics</em> methods.
                These individuals skillfully attempt to erase their tracks, manipulate or destroy evidence, and
                cover
                their activities in an effort to evade detection. By studying these evasion tactics and forensic
                countermeasures, I develop a deeper comprehension of how to uncover hidden traces, analyze altered
                logs, and ultimately restore the integrity of the investigation process, ensuring that no detail, no
                matter how small, is overlooked. This journey not only sharpens my technical skills but also deepens
                my appreciation for the intricate balance between offensive and defensive digital strategies.
            </p>
